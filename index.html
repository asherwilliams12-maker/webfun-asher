        <h2> School </h2>
        <p> I graduated from Bonners Ferry High School in North Idaho. I decided to come to (<a href="MontanaTech.html">Montana Tech</a>) to play basketball and study business. In high school I ended with a 4.2 weighted GPA and was ranked 13th in my class.

        <h2> Sports </h2>
        <p> My main sport is basketball (<a href="hobbies.html">Basketball Page</a>) but I also did track and field in high school. I did the high jump, triple jump, and pole vault. I wasn't really into running that much at the time.
