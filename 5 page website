        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p><li>Basketball is a sport that I have played my whole life. I started playing when I was about 5 years old. I played on a team in my hometown of Bonners Ferry, Idaho. 
        <p><li> I played all the way through high school and now I play for <a href="https://www.mtech.edu/">Montana Tech</a>. I love the competitiveness of the game and the teamwork that is involved. It is a great way to stay in shape and have fun at the same time.</li></p>

        <p><li>In high school, I was fortunate enough to break the all-time scoring record for my school. It was a great accomplishment for me and something that I am very proud of.</p>

        <p><li>Playing basketball has taught me a lot about discipline, hard work, and perseverance. I won two state championships and was named MVP of the tournament both times.</p>

        <h1>My Outdoor Adventures</h1>
        <p>I love spending time outdoors, especially when it comes to fishing. There's something peaceful about being on the water and waiting for a bite.</p>
        <img src="fihsing.jpeg" alt="Fishing" width="600" height="400" style="border: 2px solid black;">
        <h2>Favorite Fishing Spots</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Moyie River, Idaho</li>
            <li>Bull Lake, Montana</li>
            <li>Kootenai River, Idaho</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Fishing Tips</h2>
        <p>Here are a few tips I've learned over the years:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Be patient - sometimes it takes a while to get a bite.</li>
            <li>Use the right bait for the type of fish you're trying to catch. I enjoy fly fishing on the surface personally.</li>
            <li>Pay attention to the weather - fish are more active during certain conditions.</li>
